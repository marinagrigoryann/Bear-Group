    <h4>Tool/temperature/application: </h4>
             <p>Stir thoroughly before use, apply the paint in two layers.
               Dilute the paint for the first layer with no more than 10% water, apply the paint for the second layer undiluted or, if necessary, dilute with a maximum of 5% water.
               Application method: brush or roller. Easy to apply.
               Do not apply at substrate and air temperatures below +5°C. Wash tools with soap and water after use.</p>
               <h4>Dry time: </h4>
             <p>at a temperature of +20°C and relative humidity of 65%, the surface dries in 1-3 hours; after 6-8 hours, the next coat of paint can be applied.
               At lower temperatures and higher humidity, the drying time is longer. </p>
               <h4>Expense:</h4>
             <p>14 kg is sufficient for approximately 90 m² per coat on a smooth surface with normal absorbency.
               On rough surfaces, the consumption increases accordingly. </p>
             <h4>Coating structure/thinning: </h4>
             <p>Intermediate coat: Bear cleaning interior diluted with a maximum of 10% (by volume) of water.
Finishing coat: not diluted washing interior, and if necessary, dilute with a maximum of 5% of water.

            <h4>Preparing the background: </h4>
            <p>Remove moss, algae, decayed flakes and dirt deposits without residue with high-pressure water jets or dry mechanically. The substrate after cleaning must be strong, clean, with good load-bearing capacity and free from separating agents. </p>
            <h4>Lime-cement plasters: </h4>
            <p>Do not process new plasters for 4 weeks. The plastered areas should harden well and dry. Coarsely porous, absorbent and slightly absorbent plasters should be primed with Bear. Highly absorbent and slightly sandy plasters should be primed with Bear Primer twice (wet on wet method).</p>
            <h4>Concrete: </h4>

   <h4>Description:</h4>
       <p>Provides reliable adhesion on low absorbency substrates with quartz sand and preparation for finishing. </p>
      <h4>Package dimensions:</h4>
      <p>4 kg, 7 kg, 14 kg, 20 kg. </p>
      <h4>Destination:</h4>
      <p>Ready-to-use mineral-filled water-dispersion primer to create an adhesive rough surface for exterior and interior use. The product is intended for application on dense, smooth, non-absorbent or slightly absorbent substrates, concrete in order to create an intermediate adhesive (cohesive) layer before applying mineral plasters, reinforcing and adhesive compositions, putties, structural plasters. </p>
      <h4>Properties: </h4>
      <p>high adhesion to mineral substrates, concrete and water-dispersion coatings; water-borne; highly environmentally friendly, low odor; has a pink tint for reliable control of substrate priming; high vapor permeability (class V1 according to EN 1062). </p>
      <h4>Color tones/tinting</h4>
               <p>The product is produced in pastel pink for reliable control of substrate priming. Not subject to additional coloring. </p>
                       <h4>Gloss level:</h4>
                       <p>matte. </p>
      </div>
         

             <div class="your-slides">
                       <h4>Application method/tool:</h4>
                       <p>Stir the primer thoroughly before use. Apply grooving in 1 layer. The primer is applied with a roller or brush. To ensure the required characteristics, the primer must be applied at a rate of at least 6-7m²/kg. </p>
                       <h4>Drying time/application temperature:</h4>
                       <p>Apply at a substrate, air and product temperature of at least +5°C. At a temperature of +20°C and relative humidity of 65%, it dries on the surface in 1-3 hours. Further processing of the coating is possible after complete drying of 6-10 hours. At lower temperatures and higher humidity, the drying time increases. </p>
                       <h4>Expense: </h4>
                       <p>14 kg is enough for approximately 85m² per coat on a smooth surface with normal absorbency. On rough surfaces, consumption increases. The exact consumption is determined by the tailor's application. </p>
                       <h4>Coating structure/thinning:</h4>
                       <p>Primer coat: Highly porous, highly absorbent, loose substrates should be primed with Bear ConcreteContact Deep Penetration Primers. Adhesive coating: apply Bear ConcreteContact in 1 layer. The primer is applied without dilution at a flow rate of at least 6-7m²/kg. </p>
                       <h4>Composition:</h4>
                       <p>dispersion of acrylic copolymer, ox, mineral fillers and pigment, additives. The maximum allowable concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in this product for the EU countries (Cat. A / a): 30g / l. This product contains less than max. 1 g/l VOC.</p>

                 <h3 id="glava" class="glava">Suitable substrates and their preparation</h3><br>
                 <h4>Suitable base types: </h4>
                   <p>lime-cement, dispersion, silicate, gypsum plasters and putties, concrete, silicate and facing bricks, old matt dispersion paints and plasters, old matt alkyd and oil paints, matt facing tiles (indoors). </p>
                          <h4>Preparing the background:</h4>
                       <p>Remove moss, algae, decayed flakes and dirt deposits without residue with high-pressure water jets or dry mechanically. The substrate after cleaning must be strong, clean, with good bearing capacity and free from substances that prevent adhesion (eg fats, oils, resins, etc.). </p>
                       <h4>Lime-cement plasters: </h4>
                       <p> New lime-cement plasters are recommended not to be treated for 4 weeks. The plastered areas should harden well and dry. Apply Bear ConcreteContact on normally and slightly absorbent plasters. Highly absorbent and lightly crumbling plasters should be primed with Bear ConcreteContact twice (wet-on-wet method). </p>
                       <h4>Concrete: </h4>
                       <p> Concrete substrates with deposits of dirt or scree should be cleaned mechanically or with high-pressure water jets. On normal concrete substrates, apply Bear ConcreteContact without pre-treatment. Chalking or highly absorbent concrete substrates must first be primed with a deep penetration primer Bear Concrete Contact. </p>
                 <h4>Ceramic or cladding (indoors only): </h4>
                       <p>Matt masonry without foreign inclusions is suitable for priming. The masonry must be without cracks at the seams, dry and without efflorescence. The primer coat should be made with Bear ConcreteContact paint without dilution. </p>
                        </div>

               <div class="your-slides">
                 <h4>Coating with varnishes, enamels and dispersion paints with good bearing capacity: </h4>
                       <p>Glossy surfaces and enamel coatings should be matted and dust-free. Clogged, chalky old coatings should be cleaned with high-pressure water jets. Apply a primer coating Bear ConcreteContact.</p>
                       <h4>Poor bearing coatings, mineral paints: </h4>
                       <p>remove without residue by sanding, brushing, scraping, high pressure water jets or other suitable means. If wet cleaning, allow the substrate to dry thoroughly before further processing. Preliminary priming should be done with a deep penetration primer. Then apply a primer coating Bear ConcreteContact. </p>
   <h4>Surfaces with efflorescence:</h4>
                       <p>Remove efflorescence dry with a brush. Apply a preliminary primer coat with a special solvent-based deep penetration primer. When applying coatings on surfaces with efflorescence, long-term adhesion cannot be guaranteed due to the possibility of repeated efflorescence, which impairs adhesion in the primer and under the paint layer. </p>
                       <h4>Substrates with defects: </h4>
                       <p>Small defects (up to 3 mm) should be puttied with facade putties, for interior work use Bear Finishing Putty. Repair large defects with a repair solution. Filled areas should be primed with Bear ConcreteContact. </p>
